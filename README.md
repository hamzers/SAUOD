Spatial Awareness Using Object Detection uses input video/frames to create a relative coordinate system 
that stores the objects it detects while accounting for movement of the video/frame feed. 
The base obejct detection model used is YOLOv3 as it is an efficient and fast Real-Time Object detection model. 

This is intended for use with real time modelling via webcam or external live video source, but can be used
with a a pre recorded mp4 video.
